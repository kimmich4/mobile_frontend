/**
 * See the registered mapping of HF model ID => DeepInfra model ID here:
 *
 * https://huggingface.co/api/partners/deepinfra/models
 *
 * This is a publicly available mapping.
 *
 * If you want to try to run inference for a new model locally before
 it's registered on huggingface.co,
* you can add it to the dictionary "HARDCODED_MODEL_ID_MAPPING" in
consts.ts, for dev purposes.
*
* - If you work at DeepInfra and want to update this mapping, please
use the model mapping API we provide on huggingface.co
* - If you're a community member and want to add a new supported HF
model to DeepInfra, please open an issue on the present repo
* and we will tag DeepInfra team members.
*
* Thanks!
